### Bio

I am a student researcher at UT Austin working in applied satistics and AI supervised by Professors James Scott and Corwin Zigler. During my PhD, I have collaborated with researchers from diverse scientific fields; including cancer, pollution, robotics, epidemiology and transportation.

From the stats point of view, I've specialized on large-scale inference, Bayesian modeling, spatio-temporal data and causal inference (CI). From the AI point of view, I've worked on reinforcement learning (RL) and deep learning applications, particularly for vision. Currently, I am very interested in sequential decision problems such as RL, adaptive experiment design, sequential CI and active learning.

Previously, I have done internships at Intel AI and Facebook AI Research. During the first months of the Covid-19 pandemic, I also collaborated with the UT Covid-19 Modeling Consortium led by Prof. Lauren Ancel-Meyers, where I helped building forecasting models useful to the CDC and local Austin's Government. Recently, I also joined the UT Austin Villa team led by Prof. Peter Stone at the Robocup competition. Working with robots is a lot of fun, and it has shaped my understanding and ability to tackle problems in other applied scientific domains using cutting-edge AI tools.

Outside reserach, I like languages; currently, I'm studying Japanese: I think it is fun because the grammar is very different to English (for geeks, I would say it is like a YAML file), and their Kanji (Chinese characters) encode a lot of history. Besides languages, I also like food travel and good coffee---more than I should... On the active side, I really enjoy playing tennis and go paddleboarding on Lady Bird Lake with my wife Michelle.
