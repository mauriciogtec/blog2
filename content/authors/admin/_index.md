### Bio

I am a student researcher at UT Austin working in the intersection of Statistics and Computer Science working with Professors James Scott and Corwin Zigler. During my PhD, I have collaborated with researchers from multiple scientific fields; including cancer, pollution, robotics, epidemiology and transportation.

From the stats point of view, I'm experienced in large-scale inference, Bayesian modeling, spatio-temporal data and and causal inference. From the CS point of view, I've worked on reinforcement learning (RL) and have extensive practice in deep learning, particularly for computer vision. Currently, I am very interested in sequential decision data and related problems: for instance, RL, adaptive experiment design, causal inference for sequential treatments and active learning.

Previously, I have done internships at Intel AI and Facebook AI Research (FAIR). During the first months of the Covid-19 pandemic, I also collaborated with the UT Covid-19 Modeling Consortium, led by Prof. Lauren Ancel-Meyers, where I helped building forecasting models useful to the CDC and local Austin's Government for their policy decisions. This experience inspired to continue seeking applications in healthcare-oriented outcomes. Recently, I also participated at the 2021 Robocup soccer competition with the UT Austin Villa team led by Prof. Peter Stone. Working with robots is a lot of fun, and it has also shaped my understanding and ability to tackle problems in other applied scientific domains using cutting-edge deep learning tools.

Outside reserach, I like learning languages; currently, I'm studying Japanese and hope to pass my first official test by the end of this year. Japanese is fun because the grammar is very different to English (for computer geeks, I would say it feels like writing a YAML file), and their Kanji (Chinese characters) encode so much history. Besides languages, I also like food travel and good coffee, more than I should... On the active side, I really enjoy playing tennis and go paddleboarding on Lady Bird Lake with my wife Michelle.
