### About me

I am a Ph.D. candidate at UT Austin, working in statistics and machine learning (ML) for scientific applications supervised by Professors [James Scott](https://jgscott.github.io/) and [Cory Zigler](https://cns.utexas.edu/directory/item/3761-zigler-corwin?Itemid=349). I collaborate with researchers from diverse scientific domains, such as cancer, air pollution, robotics, epidemiology, and transportation. I approach problems using a combined Statistics+ML mindset (to exploit structure-rich data while
understanding the data-generating process and sources of confounding).  Within Statistics, I specialize in large-scale inference for spatio-temporal data, Bayesian modeling, and causal inference. In ML, I've worked on deep learning applications, particularly for images and reinforcement learning (RL). Lately, I have been investigating sequential decision-making (including RL) for adaptive policies, treatments, and experiment design in health care and public policy problems.

At the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, I joined the UT Covid-19 Modeling Consortium, where I helped building forecasting models to advise the CDC. Recently, I became part of the [Learning Agents Research Group  (LARG)](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~larg/index.php/Learning_Agents_Research_Group) and the [Robocup UT Austin Villa Team](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~AustinVilla/) team led by Prof. Peter Stone. Working with robots is a lot of fun, and it has shaped my understanding and ability to tackle problems in other applied scientific domains using cutting-edge AI tools. Previously, I did internships at Intel AI and Facebook AI Research.

Outside research, I play tennis and paddleboard on Lady Bird Lake with my wife, Michelle. I also like learning languages. I am currently studying Japanese.
