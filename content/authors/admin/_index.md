### Bio

I am a student researcher at UT Austin working in statistics and machine learning for scientific applications supervised by Professors James Scott and Corwin Zigler.

 During my PhD, I have collaborated with researchers from diverse scientific fields; including cancer, pollution, robotics, epidemiology and transportation. 
From the Stats point of view, I've specialized on large-scale inference, Bayesian modeling, spatio-temporal data and causal inference. From the ML standpoint, I've worked on deep learning applications---particularly for vision---and reinforcement learning (RL). Lately I have been interested in sequential decision problems (including RL), with a view towards adaptive policies/treatments, experimental design, causal estimation, and active learning.

Previously, I have done internships at Intel AI and Facebook AI Research. During the first months of the Covid-19 pandemic, I joined the UT Covid-19 Modeling Consortium where I helped building forecasting models useful to the CDC. Recently, I became part of the UT Austin Villa team led by Prof. Peter Stone at the Robocup competition. Working with robots is a lot of fun, and it has shaped my understanding and ability to tackle problems in other applied scientific domains using cutting-edge AI tools.

Outside research, I play tennis and paddle board on Lady Bird Lake with my wife Michelle. I also like languages. I currently study Japanese and Kanjis (Chinese characters).
